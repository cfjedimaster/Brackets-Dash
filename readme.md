Brackets-Dash
===

A simple Dash integration plugin for Brackets. Requires [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash) and OSX to work. It is driven by the current selection and hard-coded to use CTRL+ALT+H for the key combo. I may add support for sniffing the current file type so it can better filter the results.

Note - the version is a bit weird since I accidentally pushed to the Registry with 2.0.2. So 2.1 is the current, but it's really more of a 1.1 release. No prob, right?
